        <h1>Plato</h1>
        <h1>423-347 BC</h1>
        <h3>One of the best known philosophers</h3>

        <p class="container">Plato was an Athenian philosopher during the Classical period in Ancient Greece, 
            founder of the Platonist school of thought, and the Academy, 
            the first institution of higher learning in the Western world.
            <br>
            
             He is widely considered the pivotal figure in the history of Ancient Greek and Western philosophy,
             along with his teacher, Socrates, and his most famous student, Aristotle.[a] 
             Plato has also often been cited as one of the founders of Western religion and spirituality.[4] 
             The so-called Neoplatonism of philosophers like Plotinus and Porphyry influenced Saint Augustine and thus Christianity. 
             Alfred North Whitehead once noted: "the safest general characterization of the European philosophical tradition is that it 
             consists of a series of footnotes to Plato.</p>
